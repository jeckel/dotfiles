My Dot files

Files and path in this repository are relativ to the `$HOME` directory. However, I suggest not to clone this repository into your `$HOME` but in a workspace directory instead, and pick the files / directory you need by :

- create link (sym or hard)
- copy the file

Some files are "samples" files, which mean you can not use them directly, but need to copy them and changes few things inside the file (personnal information) before using it.
